## Interactive Matrix Chart of Les Miserables Characters 📚
*Build Interactive Matrix Chart of Les Miserables Characters using Flask and D3.js*

An Italian economist named Vilfredo Pareto developed 1906 a mathematical formula to describe the distribution of wealth in Italy. He discovered that 80% of the wealth belonged to 20% of the population.

A few decades later this rule has been generalized to many other applications including Supply Chain and Logistics Management.
This principle called the “Pareto Principle”, “the 80–20 rule” or “The Law of Trivial Many and Critical Few” can be translated for Logistics Practitioners
- 80% of your company revenue is made from 20% of your reference
- 80% of your volume is picked in 20% of your picking locations
- 80% of your replenishment volume will be performed on 20% of your picking locations

### Medium Article
In this [Medium Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-interactive-charts-using-flask-and-d3-js-70f715a76f93/), I try to give you a recipe to design fancy visualization using D3.js without prior knowledge of javascript (or very light).

## Pre-requisite
- Basic knowledge of HTML
- Intermediate knowledge of Python including Flask framework
- Find an example of visualization you want to design

## Code
This repository code should be used in the first step of analysis to duplicate the example found and render it using Python Flask.
1. Copy Github repository in your local folder and create a local python environment
2. Download libraries listed in requirements.txt
```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch app.py
```
py app.py
```

## Next Steps
You can now replace miserables.json with your dataset or follow the article instructions to use a dataset of e-commerce sales of perfume and cosmetics products.
